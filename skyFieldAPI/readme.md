<h> Skyfield API Stellar Data GUI </h>
---------------------------------------

## What this does
<ol>
  <li>Takes a  star HIP number  </li>
   https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hipparcos/common-star-names
  <li>Returns live Altazimuth(Alt/Az) cordinate of input HIP based on input GPS cords</li>
  <li>Display UI for ease of use and debugging </li>
</ol>

## How it works
How it works 
* Uses live data from SkyField API. 
* "Its results should agree with the positions generated by the United States Naval Observatory and their Astronomical Almanac to within 0.0005 arcseconds (half a “mas” or milliarcsecond)." -Skyfield DOCS

Skyfield can compute geocentric coordinates, as shown in the example above, or topocentric coordinates specific to your location on the Earth’s surface:


### Using python we can create a custom GUI that utilizes the SkyfieldAPI to generate ALT/AZ cordinates that can be used on the drone

*return cordinates of of HIP number '54061' from observers location*
